me,

98
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:35,850
which

99
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:36,090
was

100
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:36,290
a

101
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:36,890
prosecution

102
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:37,930
based

103
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:38,130
on

104
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:38,770
malevolence

105
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:38,970
and

106
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:39,770
incompetence

107
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:40,930
and

108
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:41,050
a

109
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:41,490
reflection

110
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:41,610
of

111
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:41,730
what

112
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:41,890
the

113
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:42,170

114
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:42,450

Justice

116
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:43,130
has

117
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:43,450
become

118
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:43,810
under

119
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:44,210
Donald

120
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:44,490
Trump,

121
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:44,850
which

122
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,010
is

123
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:45,610
heartbreaking.

124
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:46,530
But

125
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:46,650
I

126
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:46,770
was

127
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:46,970
also

128
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:47,450
inspired

129
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:47,650
by

130
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:47,810
the

131
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:48,130
example

132
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:48,290
of

133
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:48,450
the

134
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:48,890
career

135
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:49,210
people

136
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:49,930
who

137
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:50,370
refused

138
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:50,570
to

139
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:50,690
be

140
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:50,850
part

141
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:51,010
of

142
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:51,170
this

143
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:51,850
travesty.

144
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:52,510
It

145
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:52,790
cost

146
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:52,990
some

147
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:53,070
of

148
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:53,230
them

149
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:53,470
their

150
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:53,830
jobs,

151
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:54,030
which

152
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:54,270
is

153
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:54,830
painful,

154
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:55,630
but

155
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:55,830
it

156
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:56,310
preserved

157
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:56,470
their

158
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,030
integrity,

159
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:57,270
which

160
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,510
is

161
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:57,950
beyond

162
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:58,350
price.

163
00:00:58,990 --> 00:00:59,270
And

164
00:00:59,270 --> 00:00:59,470
I

165
00:00:59,470 --> 00:00:59,670
know

166
00:00:59,670 --> 00:00:59,870
they

167
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:00,070
will

168
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:00,310
serve

169
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:00,590
again.
